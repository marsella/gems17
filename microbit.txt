2) counter
	introduce variables

3) Rock paper scissors: https://pxt.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors
   or Die roll: http://microbit.org/assets/documents/04%20Die%20Roll.pdf
   or Truth or dare: http://microbit.org/assets/documents/05%20Truth%20or%20Dare.pdf

3) Extra activity: Something with communicating micro:bits, or music
	Fireflies: https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/fireflies
	Rock paper scissors with communication as a 2-person game -- the problem
		with this is that when you have many microbits going at once, it's hard
		to keep track.
	Compass: https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/compass
