Options for micro:bit programming

Day 1: Language: javascript blocks

1) Get a feel for basic constructs:
	show leds/icon/string
	construct sequences
	loops: forever

2) counter
	introduce variables
	input: a/b buttons

3) Rock paper scissors: https://pxt.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors
   or Die roll: http://microbit.org/assets/documents/04%20Die%20Roll.pdf
   or Truth or dare: http://microbit.org/assets/documents/05%20Truth%20or%20Dare.pdf
	random numbers
	input: shake

3) Extra activity: Something with communicating micro:bits, or music

Day 2: Language: Python

There's lots of info in the docs:
http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction.html
I'm not sure, this might be a lot of info to do in one session. Is it better to
give more in-depth programming problems?
