GEMS planning meeting 5/19/17
=============================

Goals for the workshop:
1) Exposure to programming ideas
2) "I made something"
3) Be open to programming and CS in the future
4) Why does it matter?

Follow up on ideas:
1) For coding projects, create a code reference sheet outlining main ideas, e.g.
loops, if statements
2) Wonder woman game on madewithcode.com: https://www.madewithcode.com/
3) Hardware for boolean logic puzzles?
4) micro:bit -- Michaille agreed to order 8-12!

Lesson plans: Michaille told us each group will have (2) 1.5 hour sessions, plus
(1) 1 hour session.

1 hour session: scavenger hunt
	- crypto caesar cipher
	- graphics/pixels worksheet
	- learn binary
	- what is an algorithm (e.g. make a pb&j sandwich)
	- mac authentication
	- eniac history
	- boolean logic

1.5 hour session: block-based programming
	- Wonder woman game? After playing the game, Jennifer prefers
	http://lightbot.com/
	- micro:bit block-based programming

1.5 hour session: text-based programming
	- expand micro:bit programming to python
	- break up with paper activities to introduce concepts

TODO: 
	- work on scavenger hunt 
	- brainstorm programming problems
