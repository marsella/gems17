> Caesar cipher.
A short lecture on Caesar ciphers should be enough to clarify the general idea.
Work a small example together, then use the provided Caesar cipher wheels to
decipher your first clue.

Materials: Caesar cipher wheels, physical copies of the first clue.

History: The first recorded instance of a shift cipher of this style is by
Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt messages of military importance. Of
course, it helped Caesar that most of his enemies were illiterate, and probably
couldn't read his messages in the first place.

While this is one of the most widely known encryption schemes, and also one of
the easiest to use, it's also incredibly easy to break, so it's no longer
recommended for any messages you'd actually like to keep secure.

Method: Let's rewind for a second. The purpose of any encryption scheme is to
send a message from one person to another, so that only the intended recipient
can read the message. 

In order to make the Caesar cipher work, the two people communicating need to
have a shared secret. In this case, our secret is going to be a letter of the
alphabet. 

We usually break this down into a two-sept process. The person sending the
message does something to garble up the message so nobody else can read it. This
is called encryption. Then, the person who is supposed to receive the message
needs to un-garble it and turn it back into a readable sentence. This is called
decryption. 

So, for the Caesar cipher, the encryption process looks like this:
1. write down the alphabet
   A B C D E F G ... X Y Z
2. write it down again, but start with your secret letter. If you get to Z and
you still have letters left, start over at A.
   A B C D E F G ... X Y Z
   K L M N O P Q ... H I J
3. For every letter in your message, find the letter in the top alphabet, and
write down the corresponding letter in the bottom alphabet. For example, if I
wanted to encrypt the word "BEAD", I'd look up B -> L, E -> O, A -> K, D -> N.
So our encrypted message is now "LOKN". 
4. THen I'd send this message and the person would do the same thing, write down
both alphabets, but instead of looking up letters in the top alphabet, they'd
look up letters in the bottom alphabet and write down the corresponding letters
from the top. So L -> B, O -> E, and so on, so they get back the same word I
originally sent them. 

> Image description
Convert between grid coordinates and an image. Watch the image take shape.

Materials: worksheets with grids and coordinates

History: Some messages may contain something other than text, like an image. But
all of our methods for encrypting messages only work on text data: letters,
numbers, and punctuation. We need some way to convert from a rich kind of data,
like an image or video, to text. This is one primitive way.

Method: If you've ever heard a TV ad, you'll notice that they usually brag about
some kind of number: 1080i or 720p. That number is referring to the number
of pixels on the screen: a 1080 TV screen is actually made up of a giant grid of
pixels, 1920 wide and 1080 tall. Each pixel can be a single color at a given
time, so more pixels means a higher-definition image.

What this also means is that we can define single moment on a TV screen by
listing out the color of each pixel. This means we need two things: a unique way to
reference each pixel, and a way to define colors. Usually, color is defined as
a triple of values: how much do you have of red, blue, and green? Today, we're
going to simplify that aspect and work in black and white. Basically, if a pixel
is "on" then it's black, and if it's "off", it's white. 

The problem that remains is how we're going to refer to each pixel. Let's look
at a much smaller example.
   _ _ _
  |_|_|_|
  |_|_|_|
  
Here we have a 2 x 3 grid of pixels. A very tiny TV, ify ou will. There are a
couple ways we could refer to this. We could just number the boxes.
   _ _ _
  |1|2|3|
  |4|5|6|
   - - -
If we want to color in the top box in the middle, we'd say, box 2 is "on". 

But if we're going to get into massive grids the size of TV screens and larger,
these numbers will get really alrge, really quickly. Is there another way we
could refer to the boxes?

< get audience input >

Okay, one observation is that this is a grid, so every box has both a row and a
column. We could use the row and column to uniquely refer to the boxes, and we'd
way decrease the size of the number we'd need to use.

    1_2_3_
   1|_|_|_|
   2|_|_|_|
 
So, to color in the same box as before, we'd say, box (1,2) is "on". 

Your next clue is an image, but we've encoded it into a text format. In order
to figure out your next step, you'll need to convert it back to an image.

> ENIAC
A short research clue to learn more about the role of women in early computing.
"Who were the first people to program computers? Find ENIAC and explain who was
responsible" 

or 

"Who was Grace Hopper? What was her role in the early days of computers?"

Materials: Paper clue, instructor stationed at ENIAC.

> Message authentication
Determine which message is the actual clue by checking the message
authentication code.

Materials: website (?) that takes messages and outputs MACs. 
  10 clue + MAC pairs to choose from (on paper).

History: Let's suppose we're sitting in class, passing notes to our friends,
and we're successfully encrypting our messages with some secure encryption
function. The problem is, you're sitting 5 seats away from the recipient of your
note, so you have to pass it through a bunch of people to get it there. Nobody
else should be able to decrypt the message and read what it says, but that's not
the only way things could go wrong. What are potential problems that could
happen between the time that you write the note and the recipient decrypts it? 

< get audience input >

Expected answers: denial of service, someone could just take the note and it
would never get there. or someone could scribble it out.
changing the message. Someone could add letters to the end, or change some in
the middle. If they're careful, you can't tell the difference. Worse, if you're
not encrypting the message, someone could just add words to it, which could be a
huge problem if you still think it's coming from your friend.

Method: So we have a new problem to solve. We need some way to guarantee that
the message we receive is actually the message that was sent.

    _____          _____
   |\abc/|   =?   |\adc/|
   |__V__|        |__V__|

OPTION 1 we could attach something that says, "Marcella wrote this message."
But, if someone learns what your special tag is, they could stick it onto any
message and pretend you sent it.

OPTION 2 we want to attach something to the message, and we want it to be
related to the contents of the message. We introduce something called a hash
function. It takes any input and produces a short number as output.

    \     ____
     \___|    |
      ___|    |_
     /   |    |_ -> ###
    /    |____|

With this kind of tool, you could input your entire message, and get a small
number that can *only* be generated by your message. Then when the receiver gets
the message, they can input the whole message into the tool and make sure the
small number is the same as the one you sent. If it's not, they know somebody
tampered with the message, and it can't be trusted.

Go to https://www.freeformatter.com/hmac-generator.html
Type the clue in the first box, put our shared secret key in the second box, and
choose RC2 as the message digest algorithm, then hit 'compute hmac'. If the
computed HMAC is the same, then you've found a valid clue! If it's not the same,
someone has changed the message, and you probably shouldn't trust it.

> Binary
How do computers represent numbers?

Materials: dot cards (1,2,4,8,16)

First, what is a number system? Numbers tell us how many of something there is,
but there are different ways to represent numbers. Ask for examples. (base 10,
Roman numerals, ticks on a board) What's the advantage of one over another? e.g.
ticks on the board take up for space, but we can use anything to represent
ticks. What can we use to represent base-10 numbers? (10 sided die, 10
individual things) In order to represent a decimal number we something that can
represent 10 different options.

Consider digits 0-9, lined up in columns--recall 1's column, 10's column, 100's
column. What is the pattern here? (× 10)

Does anyone now how computers might represent numbers? (Binary) What does that
mean? (2) Why? Computers and computer chips are made up of wires that have
electrons/current running through them. A wire can be in one of two states: Has
a current, or doesn't have a current. How can we use this to represent numbers?

Consider digits 0-1, lined up in columns. Recall the 1's column, and then what?
(×2)

Joke/puzzle: There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand
binary, and those who don't.

> Algorithm Design

Materials: PB (?), jelly, bread, ziploc baggies, knife. Written clue.

Clue: Computers are pretty straightforward machines. You tell them what to do,
and they do it. If you tell it to do something unreasonable, it won't
sanity-check you. It'll just do it. 

The set of instructions you give a computer is called an _algorithm_. For
example, you programmed the microbit earlier this week. If you wanted it to
blink one of the pixels, you'd give it an algorithm like,

  1. turn on pixel (3,3).
  2. wait 1 second.
  3. turn off pixel (3,3).
  4. wait 1 second.
  5. repeat steps 1-4.

Today we'll try a different kind of algorithm. Describe how to create a
peanut-butter and jelly sandwich. Write down the steps here. When you're
satisfied with your algorithm, bring it to an instructor to check. When you have
a successful algorithm, you will receive your next clue.

< take instructions very literally. send them back, but not more than twice >
