> Caesar cipher.
A short lecture on Caesar ciphers should be enough to clarify the general idea.
Work a small example together, then use the provided Caesar cipher wheels to
decipher your first clue.

Materials: Caesar cipher wheels, physical copies of the first clue..

History: The first recorded instance of a shift cipher of this style is by
Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt messages of military importance. Of
course, it helped Caesar that most of his enemies were illiterate, and probably
couldn't read his messages in the first place.

While this is one of the most widely known encryption schemes, and also one of
the easiest to use, it's also incredibly easy to break, so it's no longer
recommended for any messages you'd actually like to keep secure.

Method: Let's rewind for a second. The purpose of any encryption scheme is to
send a message from one person to another, so that only the intended recipient
can read the message. 

In order to make the Caesar cipher work, the two people communicating need to
have a shared secret. In this case, our secret is going to be a letter of the
alphabet. 

We usually break this down into a two-sept process. The person sending the
message does something to garble up the message so nobody else can read it. This
is called encryption. Then, the person who is supposed to receive the message
needs to un-garble it and turn it back into a readable sentence. This is called
decryption. 

So, for the Caesar cipher, the encryption process looks like this:
1. write down the alphabet
   A B C D E F G ... X Y Z
2. write it down again, but start with your secret letter. If you get to Z and
you still have letters left, start over at A.
   A B C D E F G ... X Y Z
   K L M N O P Q ... H I J
3. For every letter in your message, find the letter in the top alphabet, and
write down the corresponding letter in the bottom alphabet. For example, if I
wanted to encrypt the word "BEAD", I'd look up B -> L, E -> O, A -> K, D -> N.
So our encrypted message is now "LOKN". 
4. THen I'd send this message and the person would do the same thing, write down
both alphabets, but instead of looking up letters in the top alphabet, they'd
look up letters in the bottom alphabet and write down the corresponding letters
from the top. So L -> B, O -> E, and so on, so they get back the same word I
originally sent them. 

> Image description
Convert between grid coordinates and an image. Watch the image take shape.

Materials: worksheets with grids and coordinates

History: Some messages may contain something other than text, like an image. But
all of our methods for encrypting messages only work on text data: letters,
numbers, and punctuation. We need some way to convert from a rich kind of data,
like an image or video, to text. This is one primitive way.

Method: If you've ever heard a TV ad, you'll notice that they usually brag about
some kind of number: 1080i or 720p. That number is referring to the number
of pixels on the screen: a 1080 TV screen is actually made up of a giant grid of
pixels, 1920 wide and 1080 tall. Each pixel can be a single color at a given
time, so more pixels means a higher-definition image.

What this also means is that we can define single moment on a TV screen by
listing out the color of each pixel. This means we need two things: a unique way to
reference each pixel, and a way to define colors. Usually, color is defined as
a triple of values: how much do you have of red, blue, and green? Today, we're
going to simplify that aspect and work in black and white. Basically, if a pixel
is "on" then it's black, and if it's "off", it's white. 

The problem that remains is how we're going to refer to each pixel. Let's look
at a much smaller example.
   _ _ _
  |_|_|_|
  |_|_|_|
  
Here we have a 2 x 3 grid of pixels. A very tiny TV, ify ou will. There are a
couple ways we could refer to this. We could just number the boxes.
   _ _ _
  |1|2|3|
  |4|5|6|
   - - -
If we want to color in the top box in the middle, we'd say, box 2 is "on". 

But if we're going to get into massive grids the size of TV screens and larger,
these numbers will get really alrge, really quickly. Is there another way we
could refer to the boxes?

< get audience input >

Okay, one observation is that this is a grid, so every box has both a row and a
column. We could use the row and column to uniquely refer to the boxes, and we'd
way decrease the size of the number we'd need to use.

    1_2_3_
   1|_|_|_|
   2|_|_|_|
 
So, to color in the same box as before, we'd say, box (1,2) is "on". 

Your next clue is an image, but we've encoded it into a text format. In order
to figure out your next step, you'll need to convert it back to an image.

> ENIAC

"Who were the first people to program computers? Find ENIAC and explain who was
responsible" 

or 

"Who was Grace Hopper? What was her role in the early days of computers?"
